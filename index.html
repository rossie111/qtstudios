    <h2>About</h2>  
    
    <div class="about"> <p style="margin-top: 5px;">QT Studios is a musical rehearsal and video production space in the heart of the Tenderloin District of San Francisco. We are working on cultivating a music and video hub in the bay area that is accessible for independent local artists. </p>

    <p>As an incubation space for cultivating a radical music scene that prioritizes providing access to queer/trans/BIPOC artist, we envision giving material support, providing a pipeline to radical music scene, and inspiring youth and future generations to be part of the revolution towards dismantling white supremacy and settler colonialism.</p>

    <p>QT Studios is a space for music experimentation, rehearsal and production, and can serve as a collaborative spaces across artist who share the studio.</p>

    <p>We value transparency, open communication, and non-hierarchal use of the space.</p>

    <p>We hope to contribute to the culture of the Tenderloin -- more on this later but be nice to folks on the streets! :)</p></div>

      <h3 id="steering-committee">Steering Commmittee</h3>
        <p>For the next 5 to 7 months we will be developing the foundation for QT Studios to become a cooperative business structure in order to expand our impact in SF art and culture, and support for local independent artists.  This will include conversations around governance, finances, and membership.  To achieve this, our plan is to have 2 hour bi-weekly meetings starting mid/late October, in addition to 2-3 six-hour-retreat days.</p>
        <p>We are looking for 3 passionate musicians, artists, and community members that work at the intersection of art, culture, and social justice to join these conversations and become stewards of QT Studios' vision. </p>
