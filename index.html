    <h2>About</h2>  
    
    <div class="text"> <p>QT Studios is a musical rehearsal and video production space in the heart of the Tenderloin District of San Francisco. We are working on cultivating a music and video hub in the bay area that is accessible for independent local artists. </p>

    <p>As an incubation space for cultivating a radical music scene that prioritizes providing access to queer/trans/BIPOC artist, we envision giving material support, providing a pipeline to radical music scene, and inspiring youth and future generations to be part of the revolution towards dismantling white supremacy and settler colonialism.</p>

    <p>QT Studios is a space for music experimentation, rehearsal and production, and can serve as a collaborative spaces across artist who share the studio.</p>

    <p>We value transparency, open communication, and non-hierarchal use of the space.</p>

    <p>We hope to contribute to the culture of the Tenderloin -- more on this later but be nice to folks on the streets! :)</p></div>
