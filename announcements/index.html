        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>

        <p>It was nice catching up with all of you the other night. I just wanted to follow up on some of the items that were discussed that most of you were unable to stick around for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Equipment list</b>-Please take some time to fill out this <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/P3w3-+6UWSWrQDd6TL1WpJf6/">list</a> with all of the equipment you have in the space if you have not already. This will help us be able to determine what items in the space have been left behind by past tenants and will help with the ongoing organization process.</li>
            <li><b>Patreon</b>- We've been having a hard time filling all the artist slots for the studio and so we created a Patreon to help offset costs and keep the rate affordable for eveyone. Link to the Patreon can be found <a href="patreon.com/qtstudios415">here</a>. Please share with your networks.</li>
            <li>Demographic Survey-Moving forward we will be asking tenants to fill out a demographic survey. Its purpose is to capture data for future grant applications for the studio. Funds from the patreon and furture grants would go towards rent, interior upgrades we discussed in the meeting, times of financial hardship, etc. Please take a minute to fill out the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7UsD1_1wSBT_ZV1ntvBhlcgCH4Iw5mLr97SWX8-lu5l0DnQ/viewform">here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Finance Meetings</b>-Currently meeting every other week (typically Wednesdays) to go over fundraising ideas. They are open to anyone in the space. If you want more info, please let me know. Our next meeting date will be. </li>
