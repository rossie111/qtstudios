        <h3>6/7/2024</h3>

        <p>Hey qtz hope yall are well. Happy Pride month!!!</p>

        <p>I uploaded the recording of our last studiomate meeting on youtube.  You can follow along with the presentation I gave, and pause or rewatch as needed :) here is the link: <a href="https://youtu.be/cYx0tPR3TGg">https://youtu.be/cYx0tPR3TGg</a></p>

        <p>During saturday's <a href="https://qtstudios415.com/meetings/">meeting</a> i gave a <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/tlkyBO8d8LGVmmCLfhcvrmyl/">presentation</a> on QT Studios and a proposal to scale up and develop financial and organizational structures to become an official cooperative-financial entity by the end of the year. </p>

        <p>My ask at the end of my presentation was: <b>would you like to join the development process to scale up QT Studios?</b> This means committing to regular meetings to discuss and develop the Ownership Model Canvas, Governance Rights, Financial Rights, and meet with consultants.  <i>And regardless of your ability to commit, you be kept informed as a studiomate ;)</i></p>

        <p>Ray, Eddie and Daniel agreed to be part of the development process! And we had a great discussion after my presentation and brought up ideas around partnerships, future collabs, and revenue streams like fundraiser shows. </p>

        <p>Some next steps included meeting eddie's friend Chong (who has some experience in nonprofit work) for a Wednesday dinner and meeting again sometime this month.  
        My schedule won't be as open next week as i thought so i'd like to propose we hold off on meeting with Chong.  It would also be great to chat more about their experience in nonprofits and what things we would like to ask them before we meet with her.</p>

        <p>I would like to move forward to find a time to meet this month, for the third week of June. It would be great for us to all have some understanding of cooperative businesses and would love for our next meeting to watch together a webinar from the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives <a href="https://youtu.be/1rMxH9oklJY">https://youtu.be/1rMxH9oklJY</a> and discuss what things from the webinar feel relevant to QT Studios.</p>

        <p><i>I've also been interested in checking out the Record Bar near by cause it looks like they have a sweet patio and could be a potential spot to have a show. Was thinking maybe we can stop by there after for a drink if the timing aligns ( they open at 9pm)</i></p>

        <p>Some other news: this month kayla is leaving the studio but is staying connected to the space by helping coordinating our future studiomate meetings! Hella grateful for the coordination of our last meeting and excited that kayla can stay connected with us.   We also have a new studiomate joining us this month, Roberto! Roberto writes and plays music--he has a few different projects including a solo project, Armin, and Cupii !  Lastly, our beloved April Flowers will be leaving the space by the end of June--April will be starting grad school in the Fall and is trying to save a lil mula. </p> 

        <p><b>Here are the action items:
          <ul>
            <li>If you were not at the last meeting, please let me know if you would like to join the development process to scale up QT Studios</li>
            <li>fill out the When2Meet for the QT Studios Development Meeting by Friday, June 14 at 5pm <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?25262540-XsnxN">https://www.when2meet.com/?25262540-XsnxN</a></li>

        <h3>2/18/2024</h3>

        <p>Hi qtz~hope yall are well. just wanted to send a lil message with updates on things that i've been working on. this year i am hoping to move forward with some of the visions set in previous studiomate meetings like exploring non-profit financial structures (<em>so that we can apply for grants and receive tax-deductable donations</em>), throwing benefit shows, and boosting the Patreon. In January I started taking some business and entrepreneurship classes to have a better understanding of how to go about all those things. Have learned a lot so far and excited to learn more as the semester continues. <br type="_moz"></p>

        <p>I am super interested in cooperative models for managing this shared space. Hoping to learn more about this in the next few months. Some things that I think can contribute to this is using Asana and bringing more transparency around finances. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://academy.asana.com/what-is-asana/1605310?_gl=1*1ciwcsx*_ga*NzkwNzk1ODMyLjE3MDU2NTA2MjA.*_ga_J1KDXMCQTH*MTcwODI1MTQ2Mi40LjEuMTcwODI1MTUyNy42MC4wLjA.*_fplc*cVpvQjBjVEE2b2xSNzlmSFBsTHBoV2hqWmhXNFJoODlWUXlxUTlNOGd0NGpoeTZVaDVhV1I2V1R0VlVkYmtLYmlCSCUyQkElMkJnOTdVT1VZOGkxMGJwbTVYdlVsTVN2VGR1NWxGRWVZNndRQzdlTVMlMkZOQk1MeFklMkZFcnJ5a2FJdHclM0QlM0Q." href="https://academy.asana.com/what-is-asana/1605310?_gl=1*1ciwcsx*_ga*NzkwNzk1ODMyLjE3MDU2NTA2MjA.*_ga_J1KDXMCQTH*MTcwODI1MTQ2Mi40LjEuMTcwODI1MTUyNy42MC4wLjA.*_fplc*cVpvQjBjVEE2b2xSNzlmSFBsTHBoV2hqWmhXNFJoODlWUXlxUTlNOGd0NGpoeTZVaDVhV1I2V1R0VlVkYmtLYmlCSCUyQkElMkJnOTdVT1VZOGkxMGJwbTVYdlVsTVN2VGR1NWxGRWVZNndRQzdlTVMlMkZOQk1MeFklMkZFcnJ5a2FJdHclM0QlM0Q." class="PrimaryLink BaseLink">Asana is a project management website</a> and might help us continue to upkeep the space. Asana might be helpful in keeping up with things in the works and seeing where studiomates might be able to contribute. I make no money from managing the space so any support is appreciated to help the space continue to exist and grow. Making an account on Asana is free! <strong>Please let me know if your interested and I'll send you an invite code</strong> </p>

        <p>I also set up a bank account specifically for QT finances. This will make it easier to keep track of all the moneys and share banks statements to promote transparency as well. I recently transferred our Patreon funds to the savings account. We were able to raise ~$300 from our patrons for over the course of year! Not too shabby! Since we have a gap in the rent some of these funds will contribute to that for the upcoming month.</p>

        <p>In these last two weeks of the month I am focused on creating and sharing promotional materials to support visibility and interest of QT Studios. Hoping to make some posts on social media and send out the first QT News [Letter]. Also we need a new studiomate to join the space! Would be dope if yall could share the promo vid once its posted, along with the QT Studios Interest Form <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://qtstudios415.com/join" href="https://qtstudios415.com/join" class="PrimaryLink BaseLink">https://qtstudios415.com/join</a></p>

        <p>howdy! hoping everyone has stayed safe and dry from the scary weather.  sending a few updates about the studio space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>dan, ely, and reyna will be leaving the studio space by the end of the month</li>
          <li>launching our Patreon & searching for new studio mates start of Feb</li>
        </ul>

        <p>First, thank you to dan, ely and reyna for your energy and good intentions for the space! sending warm wishes and blessings to yall.  May new opportunies for each of yalls creative practice come your way:)</p>

        <p>These changes also mean that we will be in search of 3 new solo artist.  I'm in the process of creating a google form so that interested musician/video/image-making artists can apply to join the studio.  Will be sharing that with yall in the upcoming weeks!</p>

        <p>Second, we are launching our Patreon at the start of Feb! Hoping that this makes up for some of the $ gap while we search for new studiomates.  The first week of Feb we will be sharing graphics on our Instagram to promote our Patreon and our new studiomate search.</p>  

        <p><span class="emphasized">It would be super helpful if every studiomate can engage with the posts (comment, like, and save) AND ask 1-5 friends/family/coworkers to engage with the posts.</span> <br><span class='smaller'>**please note that this is different than sharing the post on your stories, although also encouraged and welcomed :)</span></br></p>

        <p>Lastly, we are working with a graphic designer (my homie Holiday) to make some <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10SXCUGXs0PDKtuqxB-CubY4NtvztTIpR?usp=sharing"> eye catching graphics</a> for our Patreon launch & search for new studiomates.  

        <p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/5iyvdDmTbUI-R1L-3RMtBD4U/">If you would like to give feedback on the Instagram graphics, please do so by the end of the week (Jan 22) on this document. </a></p>

        <p>Thanks for reading! <3</p>

        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>

        <p>It was nice catching up with all of you the other night. I just wanted to follow up on some of the items that were <a href="https://qtstudios415.com/meetings/">discussed</a> that most of you were unable to stick around for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Equipment list</b>-Please take some time to fill out this <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/P3w3-+6UWSWrQDd6TL1WpJf6/">list</a> with all of the equipment you have in the space if you have not already. This will help us be able to determine what items in the space have been left behind by past tenants and will help with the ongoing organization process.</li>
          <li><b>Patreon</b>- We've been having a hard time filling all the artist slots for the studio and so we created a Patreon to help offset costs and keep the rate affordable for eveyone. Link to the Patreon can be found <a href="patreon.com/qtstudios415">here</a>. Please share with your networks.</li>
          <li><b>Demographic Survey</b>- Moving forward we will be asking studiomates to fill out a demographic survey. Its purpose is to capture data for future grant applications for the studio. Funds from the patreon and furture grants would go towards rent, interior upgrades we discussed in the meeting, times of financial hardship, etc. Please take a minute to fill out the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7UsD1_1wSBT_ZV1ntvBhlcgCH4Iw5mLr97SWX8-lu5l0DnQ/viewform" >here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Finance Meetings</b>-Currently meeting every other week (typically Wednesdays) to go over fundraising ideas. They are open to anyone in the space. If you want more info, please let me know. Our next meeting date will be <b>Dec 7 @ 6pm</b>. Please reach out if timing conflicts with your sched but you're interested in joining.</li>
