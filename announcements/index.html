        <p>happy new year! hoping everyone has stayed safe and dry from the scary weather.  sending a few updates about the studio space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>dan, ely, and reyna will be leaving the studio space by the end of the month</li>
          <li>launching our Patreon & searching for new studio mates start of Feb</li>
        </ul>

        <p>First, sending warm wishes and blessings to our departing studiomates!  May new opportunies around each of yalls creative practice come your way:)</p>

        <p>This also means that we will be in search of 3 new solo artist.  I'm in the process of creating a google form so that interested musician/video/image-making artists can apply to join the studio.  Will be sharing that with yall in the upcoming weeks!</p>

        <p>Second, we are launching our Patreon at the start of Feb! Hoping that this makes up for some of the $ gap while we search for new studiomates.  The first week of Feb we will be sharing graphics on our Instagram to promote our Patreon and our new studiomate search.  <b>It would be super helpful if every studiomate can engage with the posts (comment, like, and save) AND ask 1-5 friends/family/coworkers to engage with the posts.</b>  <em>**please note that this is different than sharing the post on your stories, although also encouraged and welcomed :)</em></p>

        <p>Lastly, we are working with a graphic designer (my homie Holiday) to make some <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10SXCUGXs0PDKtuqxB-CubY4NtvztTIpR?usp=sharing"> eye catching graphics</a> launching our Patreon & searching for new studio mates.  <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/5iyvdDmTbUI-R1L-3RMtBD4U/">If you would like to give feedback on the Instagram graphics, please do so by the end of the week (Jan 22) on this document. </a>

        <p>Thanks for reading! <3</p>

        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>

        <p>It was nice catching up with all of you the other night. I just wanted to follow up on some of the items that were <a href="https://qtstudios415.com/meetings/">discussed</a> that most of you were unable to stick around for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Equipment list</b>-Please take some time to fill out this <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/P3w3-+6UWSWrQDd6TL1WpJf6/">list</a> with all of the equipment you have in the space if you have not already. This will help us be able to determine what items in the space have been left behind by past tenants and will help with the ongoing organization process.</li>
          <li><b>Patreon</b>- We've been having a hard time filling all the artist slots for the studio and so we created a Patreon to help offset costs and keep the rate affordable for eveyone. Link to the Patreon can be found <a href="patreon.com/qtstudios415">here</a>. Please share with your networks.</li>
          <li><b>Demographic Survey</b>- Moving forward we will be asking studiomates to fill out a demographic survey. Its purpose is to capture data for future grant applications for the studio. Funds from the patreon and furture grants would go towards rent, interior upgrades we discussed in the meeting, times of financial hardship, etc. Please take a minute to fill out the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7UsD1_1wSBT_ZV1ntvBhlcgCH4Iw5mLr97SWX8-lu5l0DnQ/viewform" >here</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Finance Meetings</b>-Currently meeting every other week (typically Wednesdays) to go over fundraising ideas. They are open to anyone in the space. If you want more info, please let me know. Our next meeting date will be <b>Dec 7 @ 6pm</b>. Please reach out if timing conflicts with your sched but you're interested in joining.</li>
